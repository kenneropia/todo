### Cheers to the first of many projects, that will be created by yours truly, from a desire to upskill himself

Design is from [devchallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/hH6PbOHBdPm6otzw2De5)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
